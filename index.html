                        <p>Hello world, my name is MC and I am a bilingual
                            (French & English) software developer student
                            with over seven years of hands-on experience
                            in the tech industry. I have a passion for web
                            development and hope one day I am able to travel
                            and work around the world while improving my skills
                            and experiencing new things.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Outside of coding, I enjoy playing video games,
                            watching anime,
                            playing and watching sports, coaching volleyball (ex
                            college volleyball player).
                            My true loves are my nephews and nieces, they are my
                            world and I do have a doggo named Laxus

                        <p>
                            Started in 2015, as one of the original members of
                            the company, where I was hired as a
                            Tier I Specialist + Account Manager. Worked with
                            customers, developers, product managers
                            to help identify bugs, help customers get setup and
                            fix minor app/frontend issues.
                        <p>
                            Then, after some self-teaching I was able to reach
                            the next level as a Tier II Specialist.
                            In Tier II we handled more code, helped integrate
                            applications on Shopify and worked on frontend
                            bugs. Most frontend issues were fixable and when we
                            came across some that were needing dev attention
                            (backend bugs as well) we would create Jira tickets
                            and escalate. Before leaving, I was able to gain
                            some
                            experience as a Tier II Expert & Tier II Team Lead.

                                where you ask a yes or no question and the ball
